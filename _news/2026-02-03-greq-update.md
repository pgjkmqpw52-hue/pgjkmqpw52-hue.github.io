The **MI2 Center** has officially released the updated technical specifications for the **GR-EQ Standard** (U.S. Pat. Pend. 63/902,243). 

This update addresses the integration of manifold-constrained projections within **Deep Delta Learning** frameworks. We are currently monitoring several international implementations—including recent releases from DeepSeek and Princeton—to ensure alignment with the proprietary geometric rectification claims outlined in our 2024–2026 roadmap.
